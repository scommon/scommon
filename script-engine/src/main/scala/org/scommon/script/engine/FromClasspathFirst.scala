/**
 * if no code version is ready,
 * tries to find the classes from the classpath initially. If that
 * fails, it then goes the route of finding/compiling a scala class
 * from the source classpaths.
 *
 * If a codeversion is ready, it just uses the codeversion
 *
 * This can come handy i.e. during development if your IDE compiles
 * the dynamic scala classes and you wouldn't like to wait for the
 * classes to be recompiled.
