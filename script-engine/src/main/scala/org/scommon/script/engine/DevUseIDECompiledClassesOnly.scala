/**
 * this is useful during development. If your IDE compiles the classes (and recompiles them),
 * then there is no need for the script engine to recompile those. Just mixin this trait
 * and don't call refresh (if refresh is called then it falls back to normal operation)
 *
 * Note: don't use this on production or stress tests as it will reload the classes over
 * and over again until java runs out of PermGen space.
